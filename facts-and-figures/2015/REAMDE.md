### <a id="table01"></a>Table 1. Tax Freedom Day 2014

Tax Freedom Day is the day when the nation as a whole has earned enough money to pay off its total tax bill for the year. Tax Freedom Day provides Americans with an easy way to gauge the overall tax take-a task that can otherwise be daunting due to the multiplicity of taxes at various levels of government and "hidden" taxes and fees that are often buried in the cost of living. Tax Freedom Day computed by dividing total tax collections by the nation's income, as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Every dollar that is officially called income by the government is counted, and every payment that is officially considered a tax is counted. The resulting percentage is then converted into days of a 365-day calendar year.

### <a id="table02"></a>Table 2. State-Local Tax Burdens

These data accompany the Tax Foundation's report [Annual State-Local Tax Burden Rankings FY 2011](http://taxfoundation.org/article/annual-state-local-tax-burden-ranking-fy-2011) by [Liz Malm](http://taxfoundation.org/staff/liz-malm) and [Gerald Prante](http://www.lynchburg.edu/content/gerald-prante). They are the product of analyzing data from government and public policy sources. This report estimates the combined state and local tax burden shouldered by the residents of each of the fifty states, regardless of the jurisdictions to which those taxes are paid. The burden is calculated as the total taxes paid per capita by state residents to any tax jurisdiction divided by the per capita income of that state.

### <a id="table03"></a>Table 3. State Business Tax Climate Index

Rankings based on snapshot date of July 1, 2014.

The State Business Tax Climate Index compares states on over 100 different variables in five important areas of taxation (corporate taxes, individual income taxes, sales taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, and property taxes) and then adding the results up to a final, overall ranking. This approach rewards states on particularly strong aspects of their tax systems (or penalizes them on particularly weak aspects) while also measuring the general competitiveness of their overall tax systems. The result is a score that can be compared to other states’ scores.

A rank of 1 indicates the state’s tax system is more favorable for business; a rank of 50 indicates the state’s tax system is less favorable for business. Snapshot data is law as of July 1, 2014. Component rankings do not average to total. States without a given tax are ranked equally as number 1 in that component. D.C.’s rank does not affect other states’ rankings, since it is not a state. The D.C. rank is only for reference purposes.

#### Notes on State Individual Income Tax Rates:

Brackets are for single taxpayers. Some states double bracket widths for joint filers (Ala., Ariz., Calif., Conn., Hawaii, Idaho, Kans., La., Nebr., Ore.). N.Y. doubles all except the 6.85% bracket. Some states increase but do not double brackets for joint filers (Ga., Maine, Minn., N.M., N.D., Okla., R.I., Vt., Wis.). Md. increases some but not all brackets. N.J. adds a 2.45% rate and doubles some bracket widths. Consult TaxFoundation.org for tables for joint filers and married filing separately.

### <a id="table34"></a>Table 34. Estate Tax Rates and Exemptions

### <a id="table35"></a>Table 35. Inheritance Taxes and Exemptions

Inheritance taxes are taxes on shares bequeathed estates, with rates varying by the named beneficiary of each share. Only Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania levy inheritance taxes.

Iowa exempts estates valued at less than $25,000 and annuites purchased through pension/retirement plans, and levies special rates for certain charitable and non-charitable organizations ([source](http://www.iowa.gov/tax/educate/78517.html)).

Kentucky prorates exemptions for non-resident decedents based on the net estate value based in Kentucky. So, if 20% of the net value of an estate is based in Kentucky, the standard exemption at that bracket is multiplied by 20%.

Maryland and New Jersey also have an estate tax. Nebraska's inheritance tax is levied at the county level. New Jersey's inheritance tax only applies to estates over $1,000,000.

In Pennsylvania, parent-child transfers where the child is under 21, transfers of farms and farming equipment, and transfers of some family-owned businesses are exempt.

#### Explanation of Data

These data are formatted as marginal tax rates. If statues allow for exemptions, this is expressed in the data as a marginal bracket where `estateValueAtLeast` equals 0, `estateValueLessThan` equals the exemption amount, and `estateTaxRate` equals 0.

| `estateValueAtLeast` | The minimum value of a share of an estate for a given marginal rate to be applicable. |

| `minimumTax` | Amount of tax paid in a bracket in addition to tax calculated by the marginal rate. |
| `estateTaxRate` | The marginal rate applied to the size of the share of the estate for a given `heirType`. |
| `decedentResidency` | Indicates whether the recently deceased was a `resident` or a `nonresident` of a state, which can affect the tax owed. Where blank, residency status does not matter. |
