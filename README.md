The [Tax Foundation](http://taxfoundation.org) is the nationâ€™s leading independent tax policy research organization. Since 1937, our principled research, insightful analysis, and engaged experts have informed smarter tax policy at the federal, state, and local levels.

Much of our work depends on compiling and creating datasets to illuminate public policy debates. We want to make as much of this data publicly available as possible. Beginning in August 2014, we are working toward putting our own datasets, as well as cleaned compilations of government datasets, in this GitHub repository for anyone to access.

For tips on viewing data within GitHub, see [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data). To download a specific dataset in full, click the Raw button along the top right bar in the preview window.
